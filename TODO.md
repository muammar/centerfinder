TODO
====

1. Make the program more general, because it only works for C-H structures with
   distance ranges between 2.3 and 2.7 â„«. However, users can modify these
   values in the script if desired.
- Put a verbose argument to print every process done.
- Strip atoms not desired.
- Help to prepare input file to add electron correlation methods to the CASSCF
  calculation.
- Port it to Python 3.4.
- Allow deleting parts of the molecules. This is useful to avoid repeating the
  same calculations when exploiting the molecular symmetry.
